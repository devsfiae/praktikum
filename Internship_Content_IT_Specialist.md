# Internship Content for IT Specialist in Application Development

## Internship Companies

Internship companies should operate in at least one of the following areas and must be recognized IHK-certified training providers for IT professions:

* IT Complete Service Providers  
* Software Development / Developers  
* Service Business Centers  
* Workflow Management  

### The contents listed are not exhaustive. They serve to provide focus and specification and are implemented based on company and role specifics:

* IT Security and Data Protection (Identifying, considering, and avoiding threat scenarios and damage potentials. Consulting and offering solutions to clients under these aspects.)
* Developing, introducing, and monitoring strategies for responsible use of digital media (e.g., data protection concepts, personality rights, energy efficiency, environmental concerns).
* Designing and implementing customer-specific, complex software applications, including defining interfaces:  
    * Defining program specifications and deriving data models and structures from professional requirements.  
    * Selecting and applying various programming languages.  
    * Analysis, project planning, and implementation.
* Introducing new and modified systems.  
* Consulting, supporting, and training clients and users; presenting solutions.  
* Testing and documenting applications.  
* Utilizing software development tools.  
* Developing user-friendly and ergonomic user interfaces.

## Project Work for Final Exam in the Company

For the project work, the candidate must execute a task or a distinct sub-task (timeframe/total scope: 80 hours).  
The project is typically carried out in the last few months before the written final exam, following approval of the project proposal.  

A company project is defined as **"the largely independent handling of a real customer order (client) by the internship company (contractor)."**  
It should **not** be a "fictitious" task exclusively developed for the exam, nor a research paper explaining IT functionalitiesâ€”these are likely to result in rejection by the examination board.  

The participant's operational field must be evident from the project assignment. For sub-projects, interfaces for integration into the overall project must be highlighted. The planned **timeframe** must be coherent, and handover points clearly defined.  

## Additional Considerations

Regardless of the programming project's topic, each project must demonstrate a verifiable benefit, such as:

* Cost savings from the project.  
* Time savings in work processes.  
* Increased efficiency in workflows.  
* Reduction in error-proneness and rework.  
* Potential reallocation of tasks previously requiring staff involvement.  

If these are challenging to specify due to restricted frameworks (e.g., pre-procured systems or mandatory systems), additional considerations must be provided to showcase technical evaluation competencies.  

This can involve presenting and comparing alternative model solutions based on:  

* Economic feasibility and scalability.  
* Advantages and disadvantages (illustrated in tabular form).  

Project methodologies such as **Project Management**, **Quality Management**, and **Software Engineering** receive a special focus and are reflected in the 80-hour timeframe, which is higher than in other IT professions.  

## Planning Phase

Before developing a software product, a feasibility study or preliminary investigation must confirm its technical, economic, and staffing feasibility. This phase concludes with a decision on how to proceed.  

## Definition Phase

Key tasks include defining product requirements and modeling the solution. Each product must fulfill specific requirements.  

## Design Phase

The "large-scale" programming task involves creating a software architecture based on the product's requirements.  

## Implementation Phase

Programming entails implementing specifications for system components, achieving the required functionality via one or more programs ("small-scale programming").  

## Acceptance and Deployment Phase

The finalized software product is accepted and deployed for use during this phase.  

## Maintenance Phase

Post-deployment, errors may arise, environmental conditions may change (e.g., new hardware or software), or users may have new requests.  

For each phase, the following must be defined:  

* Goals of the phase.  
* Activities to be conducted.  
* Role and activity assignments.  
* Deliverables (e.g., documents, products).  
* Templates or guidelines.  
* Required methods, techniques, and tools.  

## Project Content as Per IHK Guidelines

Candidates must analyze customer requirements, plan the project, assess its economic feasibility, develop or adapt a software application, test the application, prepare for its deployment, and document the process according to the requirements.
